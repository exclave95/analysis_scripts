## Analysis scripts for molecular dynamics simulations created by Jakub LIÄŒKO during his PhD programme.

+ Written in Python, tested with version 3.8.16
+ Installation pre-requisites (includes library version that was used for testing).
  1. MDAnalysis (2.4.3)
  2. numpy (1.24.3)
  3. matplotlib (3.7.1)
  4. pandas (2.0.1)

#### USAGE:
+ The scripts were written and tested with GROMACS trajectories.
+ The scripts are intended to be run in the command line, taking GROMACS-like arguments (e.g. -t trajout.xtc -s topol.tpr).
